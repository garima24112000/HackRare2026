You are an expert clinical geneticist assistant. Given the following clinical note
and a list of identified phenotypes, extract temporal / timing information for each.

For each phenotype with temporal data, provide:
- phenotype_ref: the HPO ID or label this timing refers to
- onset: when the phenotype was first noted (e.g. "at birth", "age 4 months")
- onset_normalized: approximate age in years (0.0 = birth)
- onset_stage: one of Neonatal / Infantile / Childhood / Juvenile / Adult
- resolution: when it resolved, if applicable (null if ongoing)
- is_ongoing: true/false
- progression: stable / progressive / improving / episodic
- raw_evidence: the exact text supporting your extraction
- confidence: high / medium / low
